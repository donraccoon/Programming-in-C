# 💻 C Programming Course Projects

This repository hosts all the projects and assignments completed as part of my C Programming course. This includes everything from foundational data types and control structures to more advanced topics like pointers, memory management, and file I/O.

## 🛠 Compilation Guide

All C source files in this repository are intended to be compiled using the **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**.

### Standard Compilation Command

To compile a single source file (e.g., `program.c`) into an executable named `my_program`, use the following command in your terminal:

gcc program.c -o my_program


**Explanation of Flags:**

* **`program.c`**: The name of your source file.

* **`-o`**: This flag tells the compiler to specify the name of the output file.

* **`my_program`**: The desired name for the compiled executable file.

### Running the Program

After successful compilation, you can run the executable from your terminal using:

./my_program


### The commands i use:
// the compile command: gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror "name of the .c file" -lm -o Hello 
// the run command ./Hello because i named the executable Hello for easy running the file
